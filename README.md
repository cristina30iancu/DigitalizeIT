# DigitalizeIT

The problem is with handing-off the equipment for the new-joiners on their first day. This issue is causing a lot of frustration and wasted time with people waiting in queues not knowing when they will receive their equipment on their first day.
We can create an IT scheduler, where direct managers/IT teams can schedule the new joiners the same way we schedule a meeting room. Managers can be notified and monitor the status of the new joiner (if accesses requests are raised and approved and so on). This would be a useful web platform not only for creating a meaningful first-day process but also to maintain IT inventory and correlate IT equipment issues.

Main functionalitites:
-	Auth 2 roles
-	Manager module:
